//! Cooperative cancellation for [async-std](https://async.rs/).
//!
//! # Status
//!
//! Experimental. The library works as is, breaking changes will bump major
//! version, but there are no guarantees of long-term support.
//!
//! # Motivation
//!
//! Rust futures come with a build-in cancellation mechanism: dropping a future
//! prevents any further progress of the future. This is a *hard* cancellation
//! mechanism, meaning that the future can potentially be cancelled at any
//! `.await` expression.
//!
//! Sometimes, you need are more fine-grained cancellation mechanism. Imagine a
//! chat server that relays messages to peers. Sending a single message
//! potentially needs several writes on the socket object. That means that, if
//! we use hard-cancellation for client connections, a connection can be
//! abruptly terminated mid-message (even mid-emoji, if we are especially
//! unlucky). What we need here is cooperative cancellation: client connection
//! should be gracefully shutdown *between* the messages.
//!
//! More generally, if you have an event processing loop like
//!
//! ```ignore
//! while let Some(event) = work.next().await {
//!     process_event(event).await
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! you usually want to maintain an invariant that each event is either fully
//! processed or not processed at all. If you need to terminate this loop early,
//! you want to do this *between* iteration.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! You can use `stop_token` for this:
//!
//! ```
//! use async_std::prelude::*;
//! use stop_token::prelude::*;
//!
//! struct Event;
//!
//! async fn do_work(work: impl Stream<Item = Event> + Unpin, stop_token: StopToken) {
//!     let mut work = stop_token.stop_stream(work);
//!     while let Some(event) = work.next().await {
//!         process_event(event).await
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! async fn process_event(_event: Event) {
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # Lineage
//!
//! The cancellation system is a subset of `C#` [`CancellationToken / CancellationTokenSource`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/threading/cancellation-in-managed-threads).
//! The `StopToken / StopTokenSource` terminology is borrowed from [C++ paper P0660](https://wg21.link/p0660).
